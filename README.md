# libdftd4-linux-makefile
This repository contains a Linux makefile suitable to compile the Grimme's dftd4 code.\\
The dftd4 excetuable and related libraries have been generated on a local cluster using Intel® oneAPI Fortran Compiler Classic (ifort) and Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) version 2021.4.0
This Makefile is designed for statically linking the libdftd4 within a development version of the CRYSTAL23 code
